To run the code, you will need a java project with Main.java and your data files in .txt format. Simply type in the name of your data
file so that it changes the final variable FILE_NAME. Then, all you have to do is click run. The output will include the results of the
data the program used for testing, followed by the rules that the program followed to predict the class.

Our program also requires your java project to have added an external jar file to weka. This jar file is in the project and is called weka.jar.
